# RemoteLink

A remote desktop control and screen-sharing application, built with **C++**, **ImGui**, and the **Windows Socket API**.
This project is designed to demonstrate advanced networking and cyber programming skills.
I implemented **TCP** and other networking protocols **myself** to challenge and showcase my skills.

## Features

- **Remote Desktop Control**: Control a remote system as if you were physically present.
- **Screen Sharing**: Stream real-time visuals of a remote desktop.
- **Secure Connections**: Basic encryption for secure communication.
- **Custom TCP**: Custom TCP implementation for challenge.

## Libraries and Tools Used

- **ImGui**: For creating the graphical user interface.
- **Windows Socket API**: To handle low-level networking.
